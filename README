This is a C++ Program that takes 8 user inputs which are the (x,y) coordinates
of 4 points.

The program forms a line with the first two, and last two points and outputs
information such as the distance between the two points, the x-intercept of
the line that is formed, and the y=mx+b equation.

Then it Checks if the two lines are parallel or not. If they are, it says that
they are parallel. If they are not parallel, it performs more calculations to
find the (x,y) point of intersection.

It also handles verticle lines. This means that if a verical line is entered,
instead of displaying the y=mx+b equation it will display and "x =" equation, and it is still able to find the point of intersection.
